<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">"mine" look innocent enough in print, but their constant and universal use is significant. They express the real nature of the old Adamic man better than a thousand volumes of theology could do. They are verbal symptoms of our deep disease. The roots of our hearts have grown down into <em>things</em>, and we dare not pull up one rootlet lest we die. Things have become necessary to us, a development never originally intended. God's gifts now take the place of God, and the whole course of nature is upset by the monstrous substitution.</p><p>Our Lord referred to this tyranny of <em>things</em> when He said to His disciples, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Breaking this truth into fragments for our better  understanding, it would seem that there is within each of us an enemy which we tolerate at our peril.
