St. Bernard stated this holy paradox in a musical quatrain that will be instantly understood by every worshipping soul:</p><p><em>We taste Thee, O Thou Living Bread,<br>And long to feast upon Thee still:<br>We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead<br>And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.</em></p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Come near to the holy men and women of the past and you will soon feel the heat of their desire after God.</p></div> </div>
