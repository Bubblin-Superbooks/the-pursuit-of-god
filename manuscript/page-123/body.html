<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">mists when we approach our Bible with the idea that it is not only a book which was once spoken, but a book which is <em>now speaking</em>. The prophets habitually said, "Thus <em>saith</em> the Lord." They meant their hearers to understand that God's speaking is in the continuous present. We may use the past tense properly to indicate that at a certain time a certain word of God was spoken, but a word of God once spoken continues to be spoken, as a child once born continues to be alive, or a world once created continues to exist. And those are but imperfect illustrations, for children die and worlds burn out, but the Word of our God endureth forever.</p><p>If you would follow on to know the Lord, come at once to the open Bible expecting it to speak to you. Do not come with the notion that it is a <em>thing</em> which you may push around at your convenience. It is more  than a thing, it is a voice, a word, the very Word of the living God.</p></div> </div>
