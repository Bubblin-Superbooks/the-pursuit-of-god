<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Christian theology generally. That is, it appears in the books, but for some reason it has not sunk into the average Christian's heart so as to become a part of his believing self. Christian teachers shy away from its full implications, and, if they mention it at all, mute it down till it has little meaning. I would guess the  reason for this to be the fear of being charged with pantheism; but the doctrine of the divine Presence is definitely not pantheism.</p><p>Pantheism's error is too palpable to deceive anyone. It is that God is the sum of all created things. Nature and God are one, so that whoever touches a leaf or a stone touches God. That is of course to degrade the glory of the incorruptible Deity and, in an effort to make all things divine, banish all divinity from the world entirely.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The truth is that while God dwells in His world He is separated from it by a gulf forever impassable.</p></div> </div>
