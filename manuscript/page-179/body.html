<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">then it becomes difficult to conceive of one that cannot.</p><p>That monkish hatred of the body which figures so prominently in the works of certain early devotional writers is wholly without support in the Word of God. Common modesty is found in the Sacred Scriptures, it is true, but never prudery or a false sense of shame. The New Testament accepts as a matter of course that in His incarnation our Lord took upon Him a real human body, and no effort is made to steer around the downright implications of such a fact. He lived in that body here among men and never once performed a non-sacred act. His presence in human flesh sweeps away forever the evil notion that there is about the human body something innately offensive to the Deity. God created our bodies, and we do not offend Him by  placing the responsibility where it belongs. He is not ashamed of the work of His own hands.</p></div> </div>
